This repository contains a project deveoped during the IronHack bootcamp done in Summer 2023.

We created a handmade database containing images of circles, triangles and stars. The goal was to create a Convolutional Neural Network
that was able to recognise the shape of a given image between the three mentioned categories.

The code implementing the model can be found in the file "Guessing_shapes.py". The parameters of the trained model are stored in the file
"Test_model.onnx".

We also created a webpage where one can test the model: . The code used to create the website can be found in the file 
"Guessing_shapes_web.html"
